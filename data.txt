Here's a prompt that should achieve the desired results:

"Analyze the following medical record, ignoring the page and line number metadata. Identify specific medical evidence of any diseases or conditions mentioned. For each piece of evidence you find, provide:

1. The exact medical finding
2. The disease or condition it suggests
3. The precise page and line number where this evidence appears in the original text

Present your findings in a structured, numbered list. Be specific and only include clear medical evidence from the record. Do not make assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated. Your response should be consistent and deterministic based solely on the information provided in the record."

This prompt instructs the LLM to:
1. Read the content without considering the metadata
2. Identify medical evidence of diseases
3. Provide the exact page and line numbers for each piece of evidence
4. Respond with specific, deterministic results based only on the given information

The structured format and clear instructions should help ensure consistent and precise responses from the LLM.

Page 22, Line 17: HPI: As you know,
Page 22, Line 18: is a
Page 22, Line 19: yr old White female with history of atrial flutter/fibrillation,
Page 22, Line 20: hypertension, hyperlipidemia. She comes in today at the request of her primary care physician. It
Page 22, Line 21: appears as though that her shortness of breath continues to increase in frequency and severity. She has
Page 22, Line 22: been attempting to do cardiac rehab however since starting she has progressively developed some
Page 22, Line 23: worsening shortness of breath. During rehab, they checked an O2 saturation and was noted to be below
Page 22, Line 24: 90% and she was advised that she may need oxygen therapy. She was then evaluated by her primary
Page 22, Line 25: care physician's office and was told that she may have pulmonary fibrosis and require oxygen therapy
Page 22, Line 26: although she was not prescribed any thus far. She states that while being evaluated there she was told
Page 22, Line 27: that her lung sounds resembled Velcro. She was then advised to move up her appointment with
Page 22, Line 28: cardiology.
Page 22, Line 29: She now comes in with her family. She states that her shortness of breath first developed back in
Page 22, Line 30: September when she was hospitalized for atrial fibrillation and continues to progress. While she did
Page 22, Line 31: smoke cigarettes in the past she quit over 50 years ago. She does not have any environmental
Page 22, Line 32: exposures she is aware of. Her shortness of breath appears to be mostly exertional. She denies any
Page 22, Line 33: chest discomfort, orthopnea, edema, palpitations, dizziness, near syncope or syncopal episodes. Denies
Page 22, Line 34: any productive cough. She denies any fevers or chills. Prior to her hospitalization September she does
Page 22, Line 35: not remember having any sort of shortness of breath.

Page 25, Line 6: does not appear to be in overt congestive heart failure. Her symptoms seem to have
Page 25, Line 7: started when she was first diagnosed with atrial fibrillation so that in itself may be the

Page 25, Line 10: medications may not be very beneficial to her. She also has not had an ischemic

Page 30, Line 14: CHEST CT WITHOUT CONTRAST
Page 30, Line 15: HISTORY: Shortness of breath and remote history of smoking. Pulmonary fibrosis.
Page 30, Line 16: PROCEDURE: Unenhanced images were obtained through the chest. Coronal reformatted images were generated ..
Page 30, Line 17: Images were obtained utilizing dose modulated automated exposure control.
Page 30, Line 18: COMPARISON: 2019 chest CT.
Page 30, Line 19: LUNGS: Again noted is bilateral subpleural fibrosis with a bibasilar predominance. Low-grade honeycombing is seen in
Page 30, Line 20: the posterior aspect of the lung bases bilaterally. Overall the changes are subtly progressive since 2019. No developing
Page 30, Line 21: ground-glass infiltrates are seen. There is no consolidation.
Page 30, Line 22: There is a 10 x 5 x 11 mm developing density in the left lung in the inferolateral aspect of the anterobasal segment of the
Page 30, Line 23: left lower lobe along the major fissure which likely represents an area of progressive fibrosis however it is more confluent
Page 30, Line 24: and nodular than other areas of fibrosis and so monitoring is warranted. Elsewhere there are stable small pulmonary
Page 30, Line 25: nodules consistent with postinflammatory nodules including a stable 3 mm nodule in the left lung apex and a 7 x 4 mm
Page 30, Line 26: nodule in the lateral aspect of the anterobasal segment of the left lower lobe.
Page 30, Line 27: PLEURA: No effusions or pleural mass.
Page 30, Line 28: NODES: There has been development of a mildly enlarged right lower paratracheal node measuring 14 x 19 mm. It does
Page 30, Line 29: contain a fatty hilum but is abnormal in size and significantly larger than on the previous study where it measured 6 mm in
Page 30, Line 30: thickness. A few additional normal size right paratracheal and anterior mediastinal nodes are seen which have also
Page 30, Line 31: increased in size but are within normal limits. These are likely reactive nodes.
Page 30, Line 32: BASE OF NECK: Unremarkable.
Page 30, Line 33: CHEST WALL: Unremarkable.
Page 30, Line 34: HEART: There is progressive moderate cardiomegaly. There is calcification of the mitral valve or possibly the mitral valve
Page 30, Line 35: annulus but more likely the mitral valve.
Page 30, Line 36: VESSELS: Again noted is prominence of the central pulmonary vessels suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Page 30, Line 37: ESOPHAGUS: Unremarkable.
Page 30, Line 38: UPPER ABDOMEN: Again noted is focal atrophy and biliary duct dilatation involving the lateral segment of the left lobe of
Page 30, Line 39: the liver with several cysts in the lateral segment of the left lobe. There are also a few cysts in the medial segment of the
Page 30, Line 40: left lobe and these findings are fairly stable. There is a stable 7 mm left renal cyst. Inferior to this is a 19 mm low-density
Page 30, Line 41: lesion not included on the previous study but likely representing an additional cyst.
Page 30, Line 42: OTHER FINDINGS: No other significant finding.
Page 30, Line 43: BONES: Unremarkable.
Page 30, Line 44: IMPRESSION: THERE HAS BEEN MILD PROGRESSION IN THE PULMONARY FIBROSIS.
Page 30, Line 45: THERE IS AN APPARENT 10 X 5 X 11 MM DEVELOPING NODULE IN THE LEFT LUNG BASE LIKELY
